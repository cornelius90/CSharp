An interface is nothing more than a named set of abstract members.
An interface expresses a behavior that a given class or structure may choose to support.

• You have a single hierarchy where only a subset of the derived types supports a
common behavior.
• You need to model a common behavior that is found across multiple hierarchies
with no common parent class beyond System.Object.
