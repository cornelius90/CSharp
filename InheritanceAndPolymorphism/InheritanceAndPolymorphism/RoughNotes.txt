The benefit of defining protected members in a base class is that derived types no longer have to
access the data indirectly using public methods or properties. The possible downfall, of course, is that
when a derived type has direct access to its parent’s internal data, it is very possible to accidentally
bypass existing business rules found within public properties. When you define protected members, you
are creating a level of trust between the parent and child class, as the compiler will not catch any
violation of your type’s business rules.
